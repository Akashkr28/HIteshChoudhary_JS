## 1. Let, Const and Var ki Kahani -

```JS
const accountId = 144553
let accountEmail = "email.akash2010@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "Jamshedpur"
let accountState // In this case the output will be "undefined" 
```

`const` as the name implies, *constants* cannot have their value changed, and any attempt to do so cause a `TypeError` to be thrown. 

```JS
const accountdId = 144553;

accountId = 2 // assignment of a new value to "const" is not allowed
```

Whereas, other than `const` like `let` and `var` value can be updated

```JS
let accountEmail = "email.akash2010@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "Jamshedpur"
//TO
accountEmail = "akash@gmmail.com"
accountPassword = "2121212"
accountCity = "Delhi" // This way of declaring variable is not good.
```

And, to check the implemented code is working or not we can check it passsing `console.log()` individually or `console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity])`
which will print the whole output in *Tabular Form*.

In the whole above documentation we can see that we are able to update values in `let` as well as `var`. But `var` is not able to cope it's work with JS scope, so it has been less preferred and in new modern JS `var` is not used.

```JS
/*
Prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functiona; scope.
*/
```
