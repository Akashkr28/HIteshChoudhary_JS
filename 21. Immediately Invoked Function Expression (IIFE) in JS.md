```JS
()() //declaration of IIFE

(function chai(){ // Named IIFE
	console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})(); // ";" is important to end IIFE, or it will throw an `error` on execution of another function.
```

**Avoid polluting the global namespace**: Because our application could include many functions and global variables from different source files, it's important to limit the number of global variables. IIFE can be used to reduce such the limit of usage.

```JS
//Another way to declare IIFE in Arrow Function

( () => {
	console.log(`DB CONNECTED TWO ${name}`);
})('akash')
```
