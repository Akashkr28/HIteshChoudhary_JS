### JavaScript Execution Context

- Global Execution Context
- Functional Execution Context
- Eval Execution Context

```JS
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1, num2){
	let total = num1 + num2
	return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)
```

1. Global Execution --> `this` 
2. Memory Creation Phase --> `val1 = undefined; val2 = undefined; addNum = definition; result1 = undefined; result2 = undefined`
3. Execution Phase --> `val1 = 10; val2 = 5` `addNum = [new variable environment + Execution Thread`. *After the 4th point process completes it will return* **Result = 15.** Also next `addNum` will execute [*repeat 4th point again*].
4. `addNum = [new variable environment + Execution Thread` --> Memory Phase `val1 = undefined; val2 = undeefined; total = undefined`; Execution Context `num1 = 10; num2 = 5 total = 15`. **After the Execution phase completes the sandbox gets deleted and return to its original place i.e. *3rd Point Execution Phase.***

### Call Stack

A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function) — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack overflow" error is thrown.

## [Example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack#example)

jsCopy to Clipboard

```
function greeting() {
  // [1] Some code here
  sayHi();
  // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
  return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
```

The call stack will be empty at the very beginning, and the code above would be executed like this:

1. Ignore all functions, until it reaches the `greeting()` function invocation.
2. Add the `greeting()` function to the call stack list, and we have:
    
    - greeting
    
3. Execute all lines of code inside the `greeting()` function.
4. Get to the `sayHi()` function invocation.
5. Add the `sayHi()` function to the call stack list, like:
    
    - sayHi
    - greeting
    
6. Execute all lines of code inside the `sayHi()` function, until reaches its end.
7. Return execution to the line that invoked `sayHi()` and continue executing the rest of the `greeting()` function.
8. Delete the `sayHi()` function from our call stack list. Now the call stack looks like:
    
    - greeting
    
9. When everything inside the `greeting()` function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.
10. Delete the `greeting()` function from the call stack list. Once again, the call stack become empty.

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.
