```JS
for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
	const element = index;
	console.log(element)
}

//Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

In this kind of loop, *the initialization, the test and the update* are the three crucial manipulation of a loop variable. The `for` statement encodes each of these three manipulations as an expression and makes those expressions an explicit part of the loop syntax:

*for (initialize ; test ; increment) {
	statement
}*

`initialize`, `test`, and `increment` are three expressions (*separated by semicolons*) that are responsible for *initializing, testing and incrementing* the loop variable.

- The `initialize` expression is evaluated once, before the loop begins. JS allows *initialize* to be a variable declaration statement so that you can declare and initialize a loop counter at the same time.
- The `test` expression is evaluated before each iterations and controls whether the body of the loop is executed. If *test* evaluates to a **truthy value**, the *statement* that is the body of the loop is executed.
- Finally, the `increment` expression in evaluated.

The above mentioned example is one of the basic example of `for loop`.

```JS
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	const element = i;
	if (element == 5) {
		console.log("5 is the best number")
	}
	console.log(element);
}

/*Output:
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5 is the best number
	5
	6
	7
	8
	9
	10
*/	
```

In the above scenario, firstly `for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++)` this statement get's executed and moved to number 5 in incremental basis *i.e.*`1, 2,,3,,4, 5` and at the value **5** the `if statemet` got executed `5 is the best number` after that loop again continues till it fulfill condition.

```JS
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	console.log(`Outer loop value: ${i}`)
	for (let j = 0; j <= 10; i++) {
		console.log(`Inner loop value ${j} and inner loop ${i}`) // 1st case
		console.log(i + '*' + j + ' = ' + i*j); // 2nd Case
	}
}
```



```JS
let myArray =["flash", "batman", "superman"]
console.log(myArray.length); //Output: 3

for (let index = 0; index < myArray.length; index++) {
	const element = myArray[index];
	console.log(element);
}

//Output:
	flash
	batman
	superman
```

#### Break and Continue

```JS
for (let index = 1; index <= 20; index++) {
	if (index == 5) {
		console.log(`Detected 5`);
		break
	}
	console.log(`Value of i is ${index}`);
}

//Output:
Value of i is 1
Value of i is 2
Value of i is 3
Value of i is 4
Detected 5
```


```JS
for (let index = 1; index <= 10; index++) {
	if (index == 5) {
		console.log(`Detected 5`);
		continue
	}
	console.log(`Value of i is ${index}`);
}

//Output:
Value of i is 1
Value of i is 2
Value of i is 3
Value of i is 4
Detected 5
Value of i is 6
Value of i is 7
Value of i is 8
Value of i is 9
Value of i is 10
```
